    </p>
  </div>
  <p>People who have already registered with us or been approved as suitable to work with children do not usually undergo additional DBS checks. Additionally, we are not required to do a DBS check on individuals who have registered with us but have never had one, for instance, if they were employed or enrolled prior to the implementation of the DBS scheme.</p>
              
  <p>To register a new childcare facility or to assume a new function with an existing registration where Ofsted determines suitability, a person who is already known to Ofsted must submit a new DBS if any of the following conditions are met:</p>
    
    <p>Between quitting the previous position and starting the new one, more than 3 months have passed. There are issues with the person, which could make them less suitable.</p>
    
    <p>The DBS has never checked them. Children now have more access to or responsibility in the new job.</p>
