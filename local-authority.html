    <p><span>The Children Act of 1989 is available in its entirety here. The main components of this legislation are:

    "a child who, in the absence of services from a Local Authority, is not expected to attain or maintain, or to have the opportunity of obtaining or maintaining, a reasonable standard of health or development; or without the provision of such services for him, a kid's health or development is likely to be considerably impaired, or progressively impaired; or a child is disabled."
  </div><br>
  <p>  Therefore, it places the onus of ensuring the safety of young kids on the local government. It is the responsibility of local authorities to make every effort to guarantee that children are raised in their own families. Given that 399,500 children were deemed to be children in need in 2019, this criterion is essential for protecting vulnerable children.</p>

 <ul class="circle-list">
  <li>We are dedicated to representing you as the early years sector's voice.</li>
  <li>In order to bring about constructive change in the early years sector, we have a long history of successful campaigning and collaboration with practitioners, peer groups, and policymakers.</li>
  <li>Direct access to the government: We frequently convene meetings with top government officials from the Cabinet Office, Department for Education, and the House of Lords to inform their work on crucial subjects including early years qualifications and the 30 hours entitlement programme.</li>
  <li>We also participate in the Department for Education's (DfE) strategic partner group, which has an impact on how early years policy is developed.</li>
  <li>We are a founding sponsor of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Childcare and Early Education, which speaks for the requirements and issues of for-profit and nonprofit childcare providers nationwide with a focus on underfunding and the 30 hours requirement.</li>
  <li>Campaigning: Our historic Rewind on Ratios campaign was successful in stopping the government's intentions to ease England's childcare ratios.</li>
  <li>The early years sector needs sustainable, long-term funding, according to the Future Funding initiative.</li>
  <li>Collaboration: In order to speak with one voice to the government, we closely collaborate with other early years organisations.</li>
  <li>
    Strong media presence: We frequently appear in local and national publications.</li>
